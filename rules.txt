Thank you for trying out OpenChat! It means a lot for me to see people use this :)

We do have some rules on the server that I would love people to follow!

1. Please do not use any malicious mods (crashers, avatar stealers, loggers, etc)
2. Please be nice to others, we're all just humans after all.
3. Please refrain from uploading any VRChat content without explicit permission from the original owners.

Press accept to agree to these terms!
